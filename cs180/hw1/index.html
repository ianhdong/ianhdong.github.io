    <h3 align="middle">Part 1: Rasterizing Single-Color Triangles</h3>

    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I first found the rectangular bounding box of the triangle by calculating the min and the max of the x and y
        coordinates of the three vertices. Then, I iterated through each of these pixel locations and found their
        centers. I defined a function that took in the sample point along with two vertices of the triangle and found
        the dot product between the norm of the two vertices and the vector from the first vertex to the sample point. I
        repeated this with all three pairs of the triangle vertices. These dot products will determine which side the
        sample point lies on and it will be inside the triangle if all three dot products have the same sign or are all
        zero. If this sample point is inside of the triangle, I filled the pixel with the function argument color.
      </li>
      <li>
        My algorithm is no worse than one that checks every pixel in the bounding box of the triangle because it is
        linear with respect to the number of pixels in this box as I used two nested for loops to iterate through the
        <code>min</code> of x to the <code>max</code> of x and the <code>min</code> of y to the <code>max</code> of y
        coordinates. Thus, my algorithm took into account every pixel in
        the bounding
        box of the triangle.
      </li>
      <li>
        Here, I chose to center it around the long magenta shape because it has a little bit of jaggies.

        <strong>Extra Credit</strong>: I had implemented a few different optimization methods. The first method was to
        reduce repetitive
        calculations by storing the six perpendicular vectors of the triangle as well as the base <code>x</code> and
        <code>y</code> coordinates with step size outside of the <code>for</code> loop. I wanted to move calculations
        that I was doing over and over that did not depend on the inner <code>for</code> loops outside of them. The
        second method was to use
        <code>#pragma omp parallel for</code> to parallelize the outer <code>for</code> loops. The third method was to
        combine
        the last two methods above. I used the C++ <code>clock()</code> library to time the execution of each method by
        placing it before and after the <code>svg.draw()</code> in <code>DrawRend::redraw()</code> and subtracting the
        two recorded times.

    <h3 align="middle">Part 2: Antialiasing Triangles</h3>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I implemented supersampling by dividing each pixel into <code>sample_rate</code> number of subpixels. From
        there, I
        resized the <code>sample_buffer</code> to be <code>sample_rate</code> times larger than before so that I could
        store each of the individual subpixels for each original pixel in the image and created a helper function to
        figure out the index that each subpixel was supposed to be in the <code>sample_buffer</code>. I then iterated
        through each of the subpixels, found the center of each subpixel, and used the same algorithm as in part 1 to
        determine if the subpixel was inside of the triangle. If it was, I filled the subpixel with the color of the
        triangle. In <code>resolve_to_framebuffer</code>, I averaged the colors of the subpixels to get the color of the
        original pixel. Supersampling is very useful because it helps to improve the quality of the images by sampling
        at a higher resolution and then downsampling to the original resolution. This will reduce aliasing and smooth
        out any jaggies. A few modifications that I made to the original rasterizer pipeline was to change the
        <code>sample_buffer</code> size and to calculate the new subpixels where each width and height became a multiple
        of <code>sqrt(sample_rate)</code> away from the original pixel. I aslo had to change the
        <code>resolve_to_framebuffer</code> to average the colors of the subpixels. These modifications helped antialias
        my triangle because it helped smooth out the jaggies due to the blurring and connected subpixels together that
        would have been otherwise disconnected.
      </li>
      <li>
        Here, I have decided to zoom into the thin red part of the triangle to show the effects that supersampling has
        on antialiasing our image. As I increase the <code>sample_rate</code>, there seems to be less gaps between the
        different regions. The reason why there are missing gaps at lower <code>sample_rate</code>s is because the
        triangle is so thin that only parts of the pixel lies within the triangle and because it is an "all-or-nothing"
        policy each pixel has its own color and there is no blending between them. As the <code>sample_rate</code>
        increases, I am able to sample at a higher frequency and on smaller subpixels and because they are so small and
        close together they lie within the triangle and are able to blend together to create a smoother image. This in
        turn allows the original pixel to have a more faded color based on the saturation and thus is able to reduce
        some of the jaggies and smooth out the fragmentations.

    <h3 align="middle">Part 4: Barycentric Coordinates</h3>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Barycentric coordinates essentially is a way to represent points within a geometric figure. In other words,
        they tell us how much each vertex of the three
        vertices
        contributes to a
        sample
        point inside of the triangle, where these weights indicate how important each vertex is in determining the
        location of the sample point. Any point inside of the triangle can be represented as a linear combination of the
        three vertices, where the weights must sum to one. This constraint will ensure that the sample point will lie
        within the triangle since each weight is essentially the proportion of the area of the triangle that the
        corresponding vertex contributes to the overall area. Another way to think about this is that we are
        distributing the area of the triangle to the three vertices based on the sample point's location. The closer the
        sample point is to a vertex, the larger the weight of that vertex will be. The further the sample point is from
        a vertex, the smaller the weight of that vertex will be. To illustrate how barycentric coordinates work, I
        created an <code>svg</code> file with a triangle and each of the vertices is a different color: red, green or
        blue.

    <h3 align="middle">Part 5: "Pixel Sampling" for Texture Mapping</h3>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Pixel sampling is a process to help determine which pixel within the texture image to sample from and use
        based on the barycentric coordinates for the sample point in the original image; it is a translation from the
        pixel (x, y) coordinates into the texels (u, v) coordinates. I implemented this algorithm by first calculating
        the barycentric coordinates of the sample points before multiplying them by the width and the height of the
        texture image so that they are in the range of the texture image. For the nearest neighbor pixel sampling
        method, I used <code>round</code> to find the closest integer texel (u, v) coordinates. For the bilinear pixel
        sampling method, I instead used <code>floor</code> and <code>ceil</code> to find the <i>four</i> closest integer
        texel (u, v) coordinates and then used linear interpolation to weight the "true" texel based on these points.
      </li>
      <li>
        Here, I have decided to use the <code>svg/texmap/test1.svg</code> file to highlight the differences between the
        two pixel sampling methods.

      </div>
      <li>
        There is a large difference between nearest neighbor and bilinear
        pixel sampling at a sample rate of 1. These examples highlight a large difference between the two pixel sampling
        methods because the
        bilinear pixel sampling method essentially is averaging the colors of four pixels and in some ways behaves like
        a sampling rate of 4 so it allows for a much more realistic and smooth representation. There is a smoother
        transition between the land and the lakes in the image, rather than sudden changes in the pixel colors. When it
        is sampling at a rate of 16, there is already a lot of detail when using the nearest pixel sampling so the
        difference between the two sampling methods is marginal at best and does not give much improvement.
      </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <br><br>
    <h3 align="middle">Part 6: "Level Sampling" with Mipmaps for Texture Mapping</h3>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Level sampling is a process which uses mipmaps of differing levels of detail where each subsequent layer is
        sampled at
        usually a factor of 4 times less than the previous layer. The different levels of detail are based on factors
        such as the distance away from the camera or the size of the object being textured. If the distance is closer to
        the camera, usually there will be a small jump in texture space so intuitively it is better to use a high
        resolution image while if there is a large jump in texture space it is further away from the image so it is
        better to use a low resolution image. I updated my <code>if</code> conditional to figure out the the barycentric
        coordinates of <code>(sample_x + 1, sample_y)</code> and <code>(sample_x, sample_y + 1)</code> to calculate
        $(\frac{du}{dx}, \frac{dv}{dx}) \text{ and } (\frac{du}{dy}, \frac{dv}{dy})$. To get the mipmap level, I passed
        in the <code>SampleParams</code> struct which contained the <code>uv</code> barycentric coordinates and scaled
        the difference vectors before finding the longest norm of these vectors. Finally, I used <code>log_2</code> to
        calculate the mipmap level needed. When it was <code>L_ZERO</code>, I used a mipmap of zero. When it was
        <code>L_NEAREST</code>, I rounded the float mipmap level to the closest integer mipmap level. When it was
        <code>L_LINEAR</code>, I found the floor and the ceiling of the float mipmap level and used linear interpolation
        to find the color.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mipmapping essentially creates caches of varying levels of resolution and acts like a pre-processed lookup table
        to quickly apply different textures onto the image. There are different tradeoffs in terms of performance,
        memory, and antialiasing power between the three methods. It is usually faster in performance but will incur
        higher memory overload to store each of the mipmap levels when compared to pixel sampling.
      </li>
      <li>
        Here are the eight combinations of level and pixel sampling on the <code>img/chameleon.png</code>. I centered the pixel inspector on the eye of the chameleon to show the differences between all of the combinations.
